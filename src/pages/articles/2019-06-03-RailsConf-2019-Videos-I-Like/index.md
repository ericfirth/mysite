---

In 2016 I went to Rails Conf and really had my mind opened. So many good and interesting talks. Every year since I wait for the videos on confreaks.tv and then watch every video with a title I’m interested in at 1.5x speed and give each a couple minutes to decide whether to move on. This year I wrote takeaways to some of the ones I enjoyed.

* [Refactoring Live: Primitive Obsession by James Dabbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhX5COR8WXc&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyaOq3HlRm9h_Q_WhWKqm5xc&index=7&t=0s)

    * Nice techniques that simplified everything, really cool to see by-the-book refactoring in practice. It's a technique that is really magical when done well
    * Really loved the touch of seeing the changes with Guard to run the tests
    * I did a version of this talk for my team, how to use the Primitive Obsession smell to improve your code, but this talk is just so much better than mine. He goes deeper and has a more interesting class extracted and explains how and why better than I did. Very impressive

* [The Selfish Programmer by Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5thkp4ZXSI&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyaOq3HlRm9h_Q_WhWKqm5xc&index=6&t=0s)

    * breaking things down. totally relate to the concept of getting overwhelmed by the ambition of a personal project
    * love the design of Justin Searls talks
    * I think of Searls as one of Ruby’s Very Opinionated People. What’s interesting is that other other language community I am a part of is Javascript or React doesn’t have figures like this. There are disagreements and orthodoxies, but Ruby seems to have certain characters around it that really get you to think holistically about software. I find myself alternately going ‘bleh’ and :praise_hands: when I hear his talks or others in this group (dhh, no one in particular but thoughtbot as an org, et al)

* [Cache is King by Molly Struve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN1rGZbwn9k&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyaOq3HlRm9h_Q_WhWKqm5xc&index=15&t=0s)
		`youtube:https://www.youtube.com/embed/yN1rGZbwn9k`
    * Simple strategies for performance and caching in Rails, some I knew and some I didn’t, but very clearly put and articulated in an entertaining manner
