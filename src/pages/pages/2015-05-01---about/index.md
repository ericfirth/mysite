Hello, I'm Eric. I am a Software Engineer (since 2015). I work mostly in Ruby and Javascript and on websites. I work for a company called [Persado](https://persado.com), an ad-tech company, as a development team lead for our enterprise operational dashboard.

In a past career, I was a not very good designer. Fan of basketball (Warriors, Nets).
